# GAN
 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
#
#### A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of deep learning network that can generate data with similar characteristics as the input real data.
# A GAN consists of two networks that train together:
###    1 Generator — Given a vector of random values (latent inputs) as input, this network generates data with the same structure as the training data.

###    2 Discriminator — Given batches of data containing observations from both the training data, and generated data from the generator, this network attempts to classify the observations as "real" or "generated".
